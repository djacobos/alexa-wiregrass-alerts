**Sample utterances**

Here is how it works:

**Dialog #1**
 - User: "Alexa, open wiregrass alerts"
 - Alexa: "Welcome to wiregrass alerts, which city would you like alerts information for?"
 - User: "Panama City"
 - Alexa: "The city of Panama City has 1 alert. It is a tornado watch."
 
 **Dialog #2**
 - User: "Alexa, open wiregrass alerts" 
 - Alexa: "Welcome to wiregrass alerts, which city would you like alerts information for?" 
 - User: "Help" 
 - Alexa: "You can say which cities are supported, or you can say exit. What can I help you with?" 
 - User: "which cities are supported" 
 - Alexa: "The wiregrass region..."  (It lists all the cities in Alabama, Georgia and Florida)
